                      <li>GitHub Enterprise for change tracking already in place</li>
                      <li>Over 2000 hypervisors worth of OpenStack private cloud spread across 4 regions</li>
                      <li>OpenStack Engineering (AKA Cloud Automation) team at GoDaddy already was transitioning to Ansible</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>95% of changes are expressed as changes to 1 repo, as 1 of 3 things: Config, Topology, or rendering of Config+Topology</li>
                      <li>Topology is the model by which we relate services, servers, and configuration</li>
                      <li>Zuul job creates a "fake" topology with the nodeset given, and renders it in to the needed Ansible inventory and variables for every job run</li>
                      <li>Each job is given access to a limited service account that lets it talk to services outside of OpenStack team's control</li>

                      <li>Deploying a mini-cloud on 5 VMs and running a slew of functional tests on it is slow - 55 minutes</li>
                      <li>When Zuul breaks, team isn't invested enough to fix it</li>
                      <li>Zuul's scale makes deployment complicated</li>
                      <li>Auto-Hold system is clunky for users, as it was designed with Zuul-admins in mind</li>
